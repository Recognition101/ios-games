        <h1>iOS Games Worth Playing</h1>
        <p class="games-intro">
            This is my list of games worth playing on iOS. Every game can be
            played offline, and none of these games offer in-app purchases that
            can be repeatedly purchased.
        </p>
        <p class="games-intro">
            The games are grouped by features. Hovering over a particular
            game will show the full set of features that game supports. Here
            is the key describing what each feature icon means:

                    Game has a "world" (as opposed to a menu of levels
                    to choose from). Note: I include rogue-likes in
                    this category.
